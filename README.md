## About The Project
[According to the wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe): The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.<br>
The Universe is one of the most interesting and mysterious things in this age of science.<br>
The aim of this project is to spread the knowledge about the universe and its all mysterious things like planets, solar systems, black holes, galaxies, etc.<br>
